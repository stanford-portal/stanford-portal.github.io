# Membership

Our member companies are a vital and integral part of Portal.  Not only do
membership fees provide essential funding for the center's activities, but
members also have the opportunity to pose research challenges from the real
world and engage with the center on solutions.

It is the intention of all Portal researchers that any software developed will be released under a corporate-friendly open-source model, such as the 3-clause BSD license.

Presentations from faculty site visits and annual retreats, and all information, data and results arising from such interactions will be shared with all members and the public.

# Additional Program Funding

Industrial Affiliates Programs may permit companies to provide additional
funding above the membership fee to support an area of on-going research within
the program. All research results arising from the use of the additional
funding will be shared with all program members and the general public.

Affiliate Program members may request the additional funding be used to support
a particular area of program research identified on the program website, or the
program research of a named faculty member, as long as the faculty is
identified on the program website as participating in Portal.

In either instance, the director of Portal will determine how the additional
funding will be used in the program’s research.
