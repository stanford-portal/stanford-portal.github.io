- abstract: With the slowing of Moore's law, computer architects have
    turned to domain-specific hardware specialization to continue
    improving the performance and efficiency of computing systems.
    However, specialization typically entails significant modifications
    to the software stack to properly leverage the updated hardware. The
    lack of a structured approach for updating both the compiler and the
    accelerator in tandem has impeded many attempts to systematize this
    procedure. We propose a new approach to enable flexible and
    evolvable domain-specific hardware specialization based on
    coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs). Our agile methodology
    employs a combination of new programming languages and formal
    methods to automatically generate the accelerator hardware and its
    compiler from a single source of truth. This enables the creation of
    design-space exploration frameworks that automatically generate
    accelerator architectures that approach the efficiencies of
    hand-designed accelerators, with a significantly lower design effort
    for both hardware and compiler generation. Our current system
    accelerates dense linear algebra applications, but is modular and
    can be extended to support other domains. Our methodology has the
    potential to significantly improve the productivity of
    hardware-software engineering teams and enable quicker customization
    and deployment of complex accelerator-rich computing systems.
