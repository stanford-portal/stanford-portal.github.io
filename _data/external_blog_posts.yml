  excerpt: "Partitioning is a divide-and-conquer approach where a difficult problem is split into hopefully easier subproblems that can be solved in parallel. This strategy is notoriously difficult to get right with SMT problems. We found that while itâ€™s no panacea, partitioning can be used to diversify solving and reliably improve performance in a portfolio."
